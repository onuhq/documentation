title: "Deploying to AWS Lambda"

Onu supports hosting your tasks on AWS Lambda. 
You'll need to use a third party library, [serverless-http](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless-http), to wrap the handler provided by Onu.

To get started, add an `index.ts` file (or `index.js`) to your `onu/` directory and add the following code snippet:

```typescript
import {OnuClient} from '@onuhq/node';
import serverless from 'serverless-http'

const client = new OnuClient({
  onuPath: 'path/to/your/onu/directory',
  apiKey: process.env.YOUR_API_KEY
  authenticator: (req: Request) => {
    // Optional. Any custom authentication logic that should occur 
    // to ensure that the request is coming from a trusted source.
    // For example, you can validate the `onu-signature` header here.
    return true
  }
})

module.exports.handler = serverless(client.app)
```


<Note>
**NOTE**

The `serverless(client.app)` call may produce a warning in some Typescript projects.
The serverless-http library supports the Onu handler, so you can safely ignore this error.
We're working on fixing the underlying type issue to resolve this error in the future.

</Note>

From here, your tasks are ready to deploy on AWS Lambda!
If you deploy using a `.zip` archive, you can zip up the directory, excluding any sensitive files, and deploy to AWS Lambda.

## Handler path
For Onu to work with AWS Lambda, you'll need to set the handler path to `/path/to/onu/index.handler`

You can update this in the `Code` section of your Function overview page

That's all! You can make sure your function is working by calling `<your_function_url>/healthcheck`.


Next, you can follow the instructions in the [Configuring your Onu endpoint](/nodesdk/selfhosting/defining-onu-endpoint) section to configure your endpoint in Onu, as well as add any required auth.
