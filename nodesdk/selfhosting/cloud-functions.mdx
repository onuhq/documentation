title: "Deploying to Google Cloud Functions"
---

Onu supports hosting your tasks on Google Cloud Functions. 

To get started, add an `index.ts` file (or `index.js`) to your `onu/` directory and add the following code snippet:

```typescript
import {OnuClient} from '@onuhq/node';

const client = new OnuClient({
  onuPath: 'path/to/your/onu/directory',
  apiKey: process.env.YOUR_API_KEY
  authenticator: (req: Request) => {
    // Optional. Any custom authentication logic that should occur 
    // to ensure that the request is coming from a trusted source.
    // For example, you can validate the `onu-signature` header here.
    return true
  }
})

module.exports.handler = async (req: Request, res: Response) => await client.handleRequest(req, res)
```


From here, your tasks are ready to deploy on Google Cloud Functions!

## Handler path
For Onu to work with Google Cloud Functions, you'll need to either: 

* Update the `main` path in your `package.json` to be the path to your Onu handler file
* OR: add the handler as an export in the existing `main` file specified in your `package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "yourpackage",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "main": "src/onu/index.js",
  ...
}
```

## Deploy

```bash
gcloud functions deploy yourFunctionName --trigger-http --region=us-central1 --runtime=nodejs18 --allow-unauthenticated --source .
```




That's all! You can make sure your function is working by calling `<your_function_url>/healthcheck`.


Next, you can follow the instructions in the [Configuring your Onu endpoint](/nodesdk/selfhosting/defining-onu-endpoint) section to configure your endpoint in Onu, as well as add any required auth.
