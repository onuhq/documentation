description: "You can reference secret variables and keys in your Onu tasks"

You can add secrets in your [organization settings](https://app.joinonu.com/settings#secrets). 
Any secrets added will be available for use in any task by referencing the `secrets` object in your YAML file. 
Secrets are encrypted in transit with TLS and at rest with AES-256-bit encryption keys.


```yaml
main:
  steps:
    - name: Send a request with auth
      uses: onu.v1.http.get
      with:
        url: https://demo.joinonu.com/api/greet
        headers:
          Authorization: ${"Bearer " + secrets.MY_SECRET_KEY}
```
