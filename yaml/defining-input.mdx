title: "Defining Input"
---

User input fields are defined under the `input` key in your yaml file. A quick
example would be:

```yaml
main:
  input:
    user_id:
      type: string
      name: User ID
      description: The id of the user being updated
```

<ResponseField name="type" required type="string">
The expected type of the user's input. 
This will control which type of input component will be rendered. 
Onu currently supports `string`, `number`, `boolean` and `select` types. 
We plan to add more types soon, so check back here for updated docs.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="name" type="string">
The human-readable name to be displayed as the label of the input field. 
If not provided, Onu will fallback to using the id.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="required" type="boolean">
Whether or not this field is required. If not provided, Onu will default to `true`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="description" type="string">
An optional description to be displayed alongside the input field.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="options" type="Option[]">
This is only required for the `select` type. 
A list of ids to be used as the options of the select field. 
You can optionally add a `name` parameter to render a human-readable version of the id. 
```yaml
district_name:
  type: select
  name: District Name
  options:
    - alameda
    - sf
    - id: sanmateo
      name: San Mateo
```
</ResponseField>
