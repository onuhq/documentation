description: "Onu tasks defined in YAML are executed as a series of steps."

You can define your steps in your yaml as so:

```yaml
main:
  input: ...
  steps:
    - name: Make call to user API
      uses: onu.v1.http.post
      with:
        url: https://demo.joinonu.com/api/users/update
        body:
          userId: ${input.user_id}
          email: ${input.email}
      result: userApiResponse
```

A few things are happening in the yaml config above

1. We create a step named `Make call to user API`
2. We tell this step to use a pre-defined Onu action, onu.v1.http.post
3. This step expects certain parameters. We set these parameters under the
   `with` key
4. The result of a step is not stored by default. You can store the result for
   use in subsequent steps by setting a variable name in the `result` key
