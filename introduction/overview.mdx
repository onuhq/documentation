## How does it work?

After signing up, you will have a hosted platform for deploying new internal tools – we call them tasks. Each task
on Onu is defined by a yaml config file. The file is split into 2 main parts – [inputs](/defining-input) and [steps](/defining-steps). The
inputs are what the task needs to run.

The steps are what define the task, and the output from one step can flow to the next. We provide templates for
defining steps for HTTP requests and posting to a Slack channel. We are working on building more integrations so
that you can build truly end-to-end workflows.

Onu requires that all custom scripts are deployed to a self-hosted endpoint. Onu uses this endpoint to run the
script. That endpoint is then included in the yaml config file as a step. This yaml config also generates the
frontend UI for the task by parsing the inputs and steps – you don’t have to do any frontend work at all.

This yaml is all you need to create a production-ready task. After a task is created, you get a clear
visualization of each step in the task, real-time updates of your task run, and built-in auditing to keep
track of previous task executions.
