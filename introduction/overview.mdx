## How does it work?

After signing up, you will have a hosted platform for deploying new internal tools – we call them tasks.
Each task on Onu is defined by a YAML file.
The file is split into 2 main parts – [inputs](/defining-input) and [steps](/defining-steps).
The inputs define user submitted values that you can reference within your task.

The steps are what define the task, and the output from one step can flow to the next.
We provide a library of step templates, predefined actions that you can use in your tasks,
such as making an HTTP request or posting to Slack.
You can browse the full list of supported step templates [here](/defining-steps).
We are building more integrations so that you can compose truly end-to-end workflows.

Currently, Onu requires you to deploy your custom scripts to a self-hosted endpoint.
You can use one of the HTTP step templates to call your endpoint.
This YAML file also generates the frontend UI for the task by parsing the inputs and steps.

The YAML file is all you need to create a production-ready task.
After a task is created, you get a clear visualization of each step in the task,
real-time updates of your task run, and built-in auditing to keep track of previous task executions.
