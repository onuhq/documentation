To request an Onu account, reach out to us at founders@joinonu.com.
Just tell us your name and email and we’ll send you an email with sign in instructions.

We’ll use user onboarding as an example task.
Let’s say your current process for onboarding a new user is
SSH-ing into a production machine to run a script that updates the database,
configures the account, and then sends a Slack message with information about the new user.
We’ll automate this task.

## Setting up the Onu SDK

```bash
yarn add @onuhq/node  # or npm i --save @onuhq/node
```

After installing the Onu SDK, create an `onu/` directory in your project and add an `index.js` file to it

`onu/index.js`

```typescript
import { OnuClient } from '@onuhq/node';

const onuClient = new OnuClient({
  onuPath: __dirname,
  apiKey: "<YOU_API_KEY>",  // <-- Add your API key here.
});

export default onuClient;
```

Onu accesses your tasks by hooking into your existing Express API. 
Add a new endpoint to your project's API to act as Onu's entrypoint.

```typescript
import onuClient from 'src/onu';

app.use('/api/onuEntrypoint', async (request, response) => {
  // You can add custom auth here
  // ...
  await onuClient.handleRequest(request, response);
});
```

Over in your organization settings, configure your Onu endpoint and its required auth.

## Creating a Task

Each task is defined as its own file within the `onu/` directory.
To learn all about how to write your Task configuration file, [click here](/creating-a-task).

For now, you can copy and paste the snippet below. There are 3 steps:

1. Onboard a demo user by making a request to Onu's demo API
2. Post to Slack notifying that a new user was added
2. Return the response body to the execution page

`onu/onboardUser.js`
```typescript
// Demo task for the Getting Started Guide
import onu from "@onuhq/node";

const task = new onu.Task({
  name: "Getting Started Guide - Onboard a demo user",
  slug: 'onboard-user',
  input: {
    email: {
      type: "string",
      name: "Email",
    },
    accountType: {
      type: "select",
      name: "Account Type",
      options: ["basic", "pro"],
    },
  },
  run: async (input, context) => {
    const { email, accountType } = input;

    // You can import and use your project's existing code & business logic.
    // For the purposes of this demo, we'll just make a call to Onu's demo API
    const response = await fetch("https://demo.joinonu.com/api/onboard", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ email, accountType }),
    });

    const user = await response.json();

    context.slack.postMessage({
      message: `Added a new user ${user.id} via the onboarding flow`
      channel: '#customers'
    })

    return user;
  }
});

export default task;
```

## Deploying your tasks

Because Onu attaches to your existing API, you can deploy your API as usual to deploy your Onu tasks.


## Syncing your tasks

You'll need to sync your tasks to Onu before you can interact with them in the Onu dashboard.

There are two ways to sync task information from your server to Onu

1) You can hit the `Sync` button in your organization settings to force a sync.
2) You can call the `/v1/tasks/sync` endpoint on Onu's API to trigger a sync. 

```bash
curl -XPOST -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>' 'https://api.joinonu.com/v1/tasks/sync'
```

To fully automate syncing tasks to Onu, you should add this sync call to your API's CI/CD workflow.

## Running a Task

Once you’ve created and synced your task, you can access its UI on the Onu dashboard.
The task page includes a few key elements:

- The input form for the task
- Task metadata
- A list of the latest task executions.

From here you can run the task by clicking on the **Run** button in the top right corner.

  <img src="/images/task-page.png" />
</Frame>

After filling in the inputs and clicking Run, you'll be taken to the task's execution page.
Here you can see the task's output and whether the task succeeded or failed.
If it failed, you can see which step was the failure point.

## Editing a Task

To edit a task, simply edit the task's configuration file, deploy, and re-sync your tasks to Onu.

## (Optional) Integrations

Onu comes with a built-in [Slack integration](/nodesdk/integrations/slack).
To enable it, navigate to the **Integrations** tab on the **Settings** screen, find the Slack integration and click **Connect**.
You'll be redirected to a page asking you grant Onu permission to access your Slack workspace.
