To request an Onu account, reach out to us at founders@joinonu.com.
Just tell us your name and email and we’ll send you an email with sign in instructions.

We’ll use user onboarding as an example task. Let’s say your current process for onboarding a
new user is SSH-ing into a production machine to run a script that updates the database and does
some account configuration and then sending a Slack message with some information about the new user.
We’ll automate this task.

## Creating a Task

Once you’ve signed into your Onu account, you’ll be taken to your account's home page. This is
where the list of tasks you can run will live. From here, click **Create Task** to get started.

### Writing the yaml

To create this task you’ll need to first write your yaml and paste it into the create task editor.
To learn all about how to write your own Onu yaml [click here](/creating-a-task).

For now, you can copy and paste the yaml below. There are 2 steps:

1. Send an http POST request to the endpoint that runs the script to onboard your new user
2. Return the response body to the execution page

```yaml
# Demo task for the Getting Started Guide
main:
  name: Getting Started Guide - Onboard a demo user
  input:
    name:
      type: string
      name: Name
    email:
      type: string
      name: Email
    account_type:
      type: select
      name: Account Type
      options:
        - id: basic
        - id: pro
  steps:
    - name: Onboard a demo user
      uses: onu.v1.http.post
      with:
        url: https://demo.joinonu.com/api/say-hello
      result: requestResult
    - name: Return result
      return: ${requestResult.body}
```

## Running a Task

Once you’ve created the task, you’ll be taken to its UI. The task page includes a few
key elements:

- The input form for the task
- Task metadata
- A list of the latest task executions.

From here you can run the task by clicking on the **Run** button in the top right corner.

</Frame>

After filling in the inputs and clicking run, you'll be taken to the task's execution page.
Here you can see the task's output and whether the task succeeded or failed. If it failed,
you can see which step was the failure point.

## Editing a Task

To edit a task, you'll need to edit the yaml. Go to the ellipses button next
to the run button and you'll see a drop down menu with an **Edit** option. This
will take you to the yaml editor where you can update your task.

## (Optional) Integrations

Onu comes with a built-in [Slack integration](/defining-steps/postToChannel). To enable it,
go to **Settings**, click **Connect**, and you'll be redirected to a page asking you grant
Onu permission to access your Slack workspace.
