title: "Getting Started"
description: "This guide will walk you through creating and running your first task on Onu."
---

To get an Onu account, reach out to us at founders@joinonu.com requesting an account.
Just tell us your name and email and we’ll send you an email with sign in instructions.

We’ll use user onboarding as an example task. Let’s say your current process for onboarding a
new user is SSH-ing into a production machine to run a script that updates the database and does
some account configuration and then sending a Slack message with some information about the new user.
We’ll automate this task.

## Creating a Task

Once you’ve signed into your Onu account, you’ll be taken to your account's home page. This is
where the list of tasks you can run will live.

## Writing the yaml

To create this task you’ll need to first write your yaml and paste it into the create task editor.
You can read all about how to write your own Onu yaml here [link].

For now, you can copy and paste the yaml below. There are 2 steps:

1. Send an http post request to the endpoint that runs the script to onboard your new user
2. Send the response code to the Onu execution page
