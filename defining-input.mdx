User input fields are defined under the `input` key in your yaml file. A quick
example would be:

```yaml
main:
  input:
    user_id:
      type: string
      name: User ID
      description: The id of the user being updated
```

### `type`

**Required**. The expected type of the user's input. This will control which
type of input component will be rendered. Onu currently supports `string`,
`number`, and `select` types. We plan to add more types soon, so check back here
for updated docs.

### `name`

The human-readable name to be displayed as the label of the input field. If not
provided, Onu will fallback to using the id.

### `description`

An optional description to be displayed under the input field.

### `options`

This is only required for the `select` type. A list of ids to be used as the
options of the select field. You can optionally add a `name` parameter to render
a human-readable version of the id.

```yaml
district_name:
  type: select
  name: District Name
  options:
    - id: alameda
    - id: sf
      name: San Francisco
    - id: sanmateo
      name: San Mateo
```
